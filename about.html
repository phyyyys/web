      Mythology is the central theme of my art. The emotional and dramatic nature of
      myths sparked my interest in this subject. Although magical and mysterious, myths
      are rooted in the real world and human nature and, therefore, easy to identify with.
      Central to my work is the female body, or the goddess, which is found in all
      cultures and is usually associated with fertility. The shape of my goddesses is
      inspired by the floral motifs of Persian carpets and the Venus of Willendorf, a
      simplified female body with limbs that resemble flower petals rather than body
      parts.<br><br>
      The goal in designing the bodies is to make them as curved as possible, bringing
      them closer to a sphere, which I view as the perfect shape. The bodies of the
      goddesses are just a sign or hint of fertility, but I don't think of them as pregnant
      women. The characters in my paintings come from diverse cultures, including
      goddesses from Greek, Hindu, and Egyptian mythology.<br><br>
      By making the figures of the goddesses similar in shape, I wanted to highlight the
      overlaps and similarities between different mythologies. Since the figure is the
      same and lacks a face, it could be any goddess, but to distinguish and recognize
      them, I take their iconography into account and depict the specific goddess’s
      attributes in each painting.<br><br>
      The goddess paintings can be divided into two groups: The first group consists of
      goddesses in human form and, the second group of goddesses depicted as
      anthropomorphized fruits and plants. In the latter group, the connection between
      the female body, life, and nature is even more visible.
